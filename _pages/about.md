Jing Shao is currently at [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) as a research scientist focusing on multi-modal foundation models and agents, with special interests in understanding various properties of current models beyond their accuracy, such as explainability, robustness, safety and generalization, towards the reliableness of AI systems. She is also an Adjunt Ph.D. supervisor at the [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), and a Co-PI of [S-Lab](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/s-lab) in [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/).

She received her Ph.D. (2016) in Electronic Engineering from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), supervised by [Prof. Xiaogang Wang](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/), and work closely with [Prof. Chen Change Loy](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/person/ccloy/index.html) and the [Multimedia Lab (MMLab)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) led by [Prof. Xiaoou Tang](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/people/xotang.shtml). She has published 40+ peer-reviewed articles (including 20 first/co-first/corresponding author papers) in top-tier conferences and journals such as TPAMI, IJCV, ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS and CVPR, with 7300+ citations in Google Scholar. She serves as the reviewer of IJCV, T-PAMI, T-CSVT, T-MM, T-ITS, and CVIU, and reviewed CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NeurIPS, ICLR, AAAI, IJCAI, and ACM MM.
